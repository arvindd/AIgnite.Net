# Introduction

.NET-based starting point for LLM-centric, Agentic, and the next big things...

# Initial Idea

With the onslaught of AI, we need to start thinking about how we can use AI to solve problems. And by problems, I mean real world production problems - such as scaling, security, and more.

With the coding assistants evolving and improving very fast, the speed at which products are developed (and even deployed in some cases) is amazing! 

While the development time is shrinking on one side, debugging is also becoming easier with AI-based chats integrated with modern IDEs. So far so good.

What happens when the products are deployed and used in the field? How will field-observability and complex bugs from the field be fixed?

While there are definitely no right answer for these questions, and many of these are yet to be experienced, one aspect is certain: having a predictable backend architecture with a large number of common aspects built into it will take the speed of development and deployment to even greater heights.

This thought drove the initial idea for development of a pluggable system that acts as a starting point for any AI projects.

We call this AIgnite - a moniker with "AI" and "Ignite" fused together - for igniting your AI projects! We have the .Net in the name as this project aims to be the starting point for .NET AI projects.
